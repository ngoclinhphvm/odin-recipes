# Odin Recipes Website
This is the first project in my Web Development learning process, guided by The Odin Project.

It is a basic recipe website to enhance my HTML skills, so it might not be the most visually appealing.

All the images and recipes are sourced from [Allrecipes](https://www.allrecipes.com). I plan to include individual sources for each recipe soon.
